## Let's get started with GPTs-Filtor!! ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€
### Quick Start
```bash
osascript /path/to/gpts_interaction_script.scpt
```
### Step 1: Specify GPT URLs
- Open the `GPTs-Filtor/GPTs.txt` file.
- Add the GPT URLs you wish to test. Each URL should be on a new line.
  *Note: Three example URLs have already been provided in `GPTs.txt`.*

### Step 2: Modify Test Prompts
- Navigate to `GPTs-Filtor/gpts_interaction_script`.
- Locate the `sentenceList` variable.
- Modify the prompts to the ones you want to test.
- The script will randomly pick from these test cases during execution.


### Step 3: Modify Test Prompts
- Run Charles Proxy
- Select `auto save` under the `Tool`.

## Notes
- The script allows for multiple interactions per experiment.
- If changes are needed, only update the values of each `keystroke`.
- Ensure stable network connectivity for smooth interaction with GPTs.
